### Hi there 👋 I am Sasha! 

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Brooklyn, New York. 

I love learning and solving problems, appreciate technologies, and always happy to discover something new.

My first programming language is JavaScript and currently, I learn Python.
Also, I built applications with Node, HTML, CSS, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Express, SQL, and Sequalize.

### My main three mottos for life:
"Never stop learning!" 🧐🔭
"Make it work!" 👍🏼
"Smile can change the world!" 😁
